# Cerulean Color Theme

A cool blue color theme with just the right amount of contrast. In-editor color
use is kept to a minimum to let the code come to the forefront. Subtle
bold and italic text treatments help indicate syntax where it's useful.

Tested with:

- C++
- Ruby
- Python
- Go
- Javascript
- JSON
- Markdown
