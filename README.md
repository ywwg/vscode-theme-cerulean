# Cerulean Color Theme

A cool blue color theme for Visual Studio Code with just the right amount of contrast. In-editor color use is kept to a minimum to let the code come to the forefront. Subtle bold and italic text treatments help indicate syntax where it's useful.

Now includes a light theme, in beta!
